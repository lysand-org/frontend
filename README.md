### Browser Support

The following browsers are **supported** (issues will be prioritized):
- **Chromium**: `110+`
- **Firefox**: `110+`
- **Safari**: `16+`
- **IE**: None.

The following browsers will very likely work, but are not officially supported:
- **Chromium**: `80+`
- **Firefox**: `80+`
- **Safari**: `12+`
- **IE**: None.

Other browsers may work, but are not guaranteed to.

## Performance

### JavaScript Bloat

The **total** JavaScript bundle size is less than `900 kB`, but this is made even smaller by the fact that the bundle is split into multiple files, and only the necessary files are loaded on each page.

### Benchmarks

Benchmarks are due to be conducted soonâ„¢.

## Installation

Lysand-FE is included in the provided `docker-compose` file during [Lysand Server installation](https://github.com/lysand-org/lysand/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

To have Lysand-FE and Lysand Server running on the same domain, edit the Lysand Server configuration to point to the Lysand-FE container's address (`frontend` category inside config).

### Manual Installation

Here are the steps to install Lysand-FE manually:

#### Docker/Podman

```yaml
services:
    fe:
        image: ghcr.io/lysand-org/lysand-fe:main
        container_name: lysand-fe
        restart: unless-stopped
        networks:
            - lysand-net
        environment:
            NUXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST: https://yourserver.com
```

Then, the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` inside the container. To link it to a Lysand Server, set the `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST` environment variable to the server's URL.
